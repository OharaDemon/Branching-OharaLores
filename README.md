So, a little bit about myself: My name is Kim, a 26y.o male from Malaysia. Who just recently-turned-to-be hobbyist. 
And since in that same 'recent time' i happen to be jobless, i got plenty of free times that i decided to try to see whether if im able to learn some new skills or not. Hopefully I will get some helps and supports from you guys here in doing so. Peace :)
